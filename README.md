## Harbor for laravel / craftable / php ##

Harbor provides docker configuration for your project. It is based on vessel by Fideloper LLC - https://vessel.shippingdocker.com/. It consist of
 
* nginx container, 
* php container, 
* postgres container, 
* testing postgres container,
* node container,
* redis container

This script handles the current instance. To create new, install or update harbor, use harbor installer.

### Let's init laravel / craftable ###

If you have an existing laravel / craftable project and you have not initialize this project, run 

`harbor init`

which will setup some .env variables, install required packages and will run npm

### Starting a harbor (docker) ###

To start the docker environment use:

`harbor start`

This will start all the docker containers and set up network and volumes correctly. So now we can play around with empty PostgreSQL or php. Now you can point your browser to the http://localhost and you should be able to see a default `/` route mapped to public/index.php.

### Rebuild a harbor (docker) ###

In case you change some env values for docker, or changes some docker file or other configuration, you should run

`harbor rebuild`

NOTE: To rebuild images use `-i|--images`, to destroy volumes use `-v|--volumes`

`harbor stop` will stop and destroy all containers.

`harbor restart`will stop and destroy and then starts again all containers.

`harbor rebuild` will stop and destroy all containers then starts again all containers, build them if changes has been made.

`harbor artisan` OR `harbor art` will pass all additional arguments to php container to php artisan command, e.g. `harbor art make:migration` goes to php docker container and call `php artisan make:migration`.

`harbor composer` OR `harbor comp` will pass all additional arguments to php container to composer command, e.g. `harbor comp require brackets/craftable` goes to php docker container and call `composer require brackets/craftable`.
